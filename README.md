# Raytracer
Dead simple raytracer.

# Steps for Building

You will need to install Visual Studio, if you haven't already.
At the time of writing, I am using the 2022 version.
I cannot guarentee proper building for any subsequent versions.
Please note that if your Visual Studio version is different than 2022,
you will need to change shell.bat accordingly.

To build and run the raytracer on the scene, please run the following.

```bash
shell.bat
build.bat
```

Happy raytracing!
